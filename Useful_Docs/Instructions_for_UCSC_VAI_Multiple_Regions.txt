To use Variant Annotation Integrator for multiple regions / own UCSC tracks:
  1. Create a UCSC track for your genomic SNP dataset (e.g. Gough and Germany genomes). 
  2. Load your own track.
  3. Go to Table Browser, select your own track for option 'group';  upload your regions of interest (e.g. All Gough QTLs bed file) under option 'Defined region of   interest'; all fields from selected table (default) for output format; give a file name with vcf extension. And you'll get the vcf file for the regions of your interest for your own data.
  4. Go to VAI, click on 'add custom track' under 'Select Variants'; upload the vcf file created in Step #3. And you'll get the mutation types for SNPs in defined regions.
  5. To figure out which genomes carry which alleles for all missense mutations (e.g. Gough or Germany, this information got lost in Step #4), you'll need to check the allele information for your genomes with the vcf file generated in step #3.

Note: You can use VAI web interface directly if you only have one region. VAI limit is 100,000 variants
